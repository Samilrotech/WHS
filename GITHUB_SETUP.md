# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status

The old GitHub repository connection has been **removed**.

Your local repository still has:
- All commits intact (including the latest `c0492d4`)
- All files and changes preserved
- Git history maintained

---

## Option 1: Create New GitHub Repository via Web

### Step 1: Delete Old Repository on GitHub (Optional)
1. Go to https://github.com/Samilrotech/rotech-whs
2. Click **Settings** (bottom of right sidebar)
3. Scroll to bottom → **Danger Zone**
4. Click **Delete this repository**
5. Type repository name to confirm
6. Click **I understand the consequences, delete this repository**

### Step 2: Create New GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `rotech-whs` (or choose a new name)
3. **Description**: `WHS5 - Workplace Health & Safety Management System`
4. **Visibility**: Private or Public (your choice)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **Create repository**

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to New Remote

GitHub will show you commands like this:

```bash
cd D:\WHS5

# Add the new remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Samilrotech/NEW-REPO-NAME.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin master
```

**Or with SSH** (if you have SSH keys set up):
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:Samilrotech/NEW-REPO-NAME.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 2: Create New Repository via GitHub CLI

### Prerequisites
Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/

### Steps

```bash
# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create new repository
gh repo create Samilrotech/rotech-whs --private --source=. --remote=origin --description "WHS5 - Workplace Health & Safety Management System"

# Push your code
git push -u origin master
```

**Flags Explained**:
- `--private` - Makes repository private (use `--public` for public)
- `--source=.` - Uses current directory
- `--remote=origin` - Sets up 'origin' remote
- `--description` - Repository description

---

## Option 3: Keep Local Only (No GitHub)

If you don't want to push to GitHub right now:

```bash
# Your repository is already set up locally
# Just continue working as normal
git status
git log

# You can add a remote later when ready
```

---

## Authentication Setup

### For HTTPS (Recommended for Windows)

**Personal Access Token** (required for HTTPS):
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **Generate new token (classic)**
3. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (if using GitHub Actions)
4. Click **Generate token**
5. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)
6. When pushing, use token as password:
   ```
   Username: Samilrotech
   Password: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

**Store Credentials** (so you don't have to enter token every time):
```bash
# Windows Credential Manager
git config --global credential.helper wincred

# First push will ask for token, then it's stored
```

### For SSH (Alternative)

**Generate SSH Key**:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Press Enter to accept default location
# Enter passphrase (optional)
```

**Add SSH Key to GitHub**:
1. Copy public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
2. Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Click **New SSH key**
4. Paste key and save
5. Test connection:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

**Use SSH URL**:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:Samilrotech/rotech-whs.git
```

## Recommended: Create .gitignore Additions

Add these to `.gitignore` to keep repository clean:

```bash
cat >> .gitignore << 'EOF'

# Compiled views (regenerated automatically)
/storage/framework/views/*.php
!/storage/framework/views/.gitignore

# Temporary files
temp_*.php
*.old

# Environment files with secrets
.env.local
.env.*.local

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Build artifacts
/public/build/*
!/public/build/.gitignore
EOF
```

Then commit:
```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: Update gitignore for cleaner repository"
```

---

## Quick Start Commands

### Scenario A: Create New Private Repo and Push
```bash
cd D:\WHS5

# Using GitHub CLI (easiest)
gh auth login
gh repo create Samilrotech/whs5-production --private --source=. --remote=origin
git push -u origin master

# Or manually
# 1. Create repo on GitHub.com
# 2. Copy the URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/Samilrotech/YOUR-NEW-REPO.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Scenario B: Push to Existing Empty Repo
```bash
cd D:\WHS5
git remote add origin https://github.com/Samilrotech/EXISTING-REPO.git
git push -u origin master
```

### Scenario C: Keep Local Only
```bash
# Nothing to do - you're already set up!
# Your commits are safe in D:\WHS5\.git
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found" Error
- Check repository name spelling
- Verify you have access (private repo?)
- Check if repository exists on GitHub

### "Authentication failed" Error
- For HTTPS: Use Personal Access Token, not password
- For SSH: Verify SSH key is added to GitHub
- Check credentials: `git config --global credential.helper`

### "Failed to push some refs" Error
- Remote has changes you don't have locally
- Solution: `git pull origin master --rebase` then `git push`

### Want to Rename Repository?
```bash
# After renaming on GitHub
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Samilrotech/NEW-NAME.git
```

**What You Need to Do**:
1. **Decide**: Delete old GitHub repo or keep it?
2. **Create**: New GitHub repository (via web or CLI)
3. **Connect**: Add new remote to local repository
4. **Push**: Upload all commits to new repository

**Current State**:
```
Local Repository: D:\WHS5
Branch: master
Latest Commit: c0492d4
Remote: None (ready to add new one)
```
