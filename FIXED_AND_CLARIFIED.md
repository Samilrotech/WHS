# ✅ WHS5 Deployment - Fixed and Clarified

## 🎉 Issue Resolved!

**Problem**: "This page isn't working" error
**Cause**: Storage directory permissions preventing Laravel from writing logs
**Solution**: Fixed permissions on `/var/www/whs/storage` and `/var/www/whs/bootstrap/cache`

**Status**: ✅ **WORKING NOW!**

---

## 🌐 Accessing Your WHS5 Application

### Method 1: Via IP Address (Working Now)

**URL**: http://147.79.67.122

This works because:
- Server is at IP: 147.79.67.122
- We added the IP to Nginx `server_name` configuration temporarily for testing

### Method 2: Via Domain Name (After DNS)

**URL**: http://whs.rotechrural.com.au

This will work after you add DNS:
```
Type: A
Name: whs
Value: 147.79.67.122
```

## ❓ Why "whs5" in folder name but "whs" in domain?

Good question! Here's the clarification:

### Application Name: WHS5
- **Full Name**: WHS5 - Workplace Health & Safety System
- **"5"** indicates: Version 5 or System 5
- Used in: Project documentation, database name (`whs5_production`)

### Domain Name: whs.rotechrural.com.au
- **Subdomain**: `whs` (shorter, cleaner URL for users)
- **No "5"** because: URLs should be simple and permanent
- If you make WHS6 later, you keep the same domain

### Folder Name: /var/www/whs
- **Directory**: `whs` (matches domain, not app version)
- **Why**: Easier to remember, consistent with URL

**Analogy**:
- Your application is "iPhone 15" (version number)
- Your website is "apple.com/iphone" (clean URL)
- Your folder is "/var/www/iphone" (simple path)

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Storage Permissions
```bash
# Before (broken):
drwxr-xr-x storage/logs  # www-data couldn't write

# After (fixed):
drwxrwxr-x storage/logs  # www-data can write
```

### 2. Cache Cleared
- Configuration cache cleared
- Application cache cleared
- Laravel can now generate new cache files with proper permissions

### 3. Log File Created
- Created `/var/www/whs/storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Set proper ownership: `www-data:www-data`
- Laravel can now write error logs

## 🧪 Current Status

### Both Applications Working

| Application | Domain | IP Access | Status |
|-------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **QA** | qa.rotechrural.com.au | Yes (default) | ✅ Working with SSL |
| **WHS5** | whs.rotechrural.com.au (pending DNS) | http://147.79.67.122 | ✅ Working |

### Test Now!

**Open browser and go to**: http://147.79.67.122

You should see:
1. ✅ WHS5 login page
2. ✅ Sensei dark theme
3. ✅ No errors

**Login**:
- Email: `admin@whs4.com.au`
- Password: `Admin@2025!`

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Test the Application

Login and verify:
- ✅ Dashboard loads
- ✅ Team Management works
- ✅ Vehicle Management works
- ✅ All modules accessible
- ✅ Create/Edit functions work

### 2. Add DNS Record

In your domain registrar:
```
Type: A
Name: whs
Value: 147.79.67.122
TTL: 3600
```

### 3. Install SSL (after DNS)

Once DNS works:
```bash
ssh -i D:\WHS5\hostinger_whs5_key root@147.79.67.122
certbot --nginx -d whs.rotechrural.com.au -d www.whs.rotechrural.com.au
```

This will:
- Enable HTTPS (https://whs.rotechrural.com.au)
- Auto-renew every 90 days
- Update Nginx automatically

### 4. Remove IP from server_name (Optional)

After DNS works, remove the IP from Nginx config:

```bash
ssh -i D:\WHS5\hostinger_whs5_key root@147.79.67.122

# Edit config
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/whs.rotechrural.com.au

# Change this line:
server_name whs.rotechrural.com.au www.whs.rotechrural.com.au 147.79.67.122;

# To this (remove IP):
server_name whs.rotechrural.com.au www.whs.rotechrural.com.au;

# Test and reload
nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx
```

## 📊 Architecture Explained

### Same Server, Multiple Applications

```
Hostinger VPS (147.79.67.122)
│
├── Nginx (Web Server)
│   ├── qa.rotechrural.com.au → /var/www/qa-app/public
│   └── whs.rotechrural.com.au → /var/www/whs/public
│
├── PHP-FPM (Process Manager)
│   └── Handles PHP for both apps
│
└── MySQL (Database)
    ├── qa_database (for QA app)
    └── whs5_production (for WHS5 app)
```

**How it works**:
1. Browser requests `qa.rotechrural.com.au`
2. Nginx looks at `server_name` in configs
3. Routes to `/var/www/qa-app/public`
4. PHP-FPM processes Laravel
5. Returns response

Same process for WHS5!

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check Application Status
```bash
ssh -i D:\WHS5\hostinger_whs5_key root@147.79.67.122

# Check if WHS5 responds
curl -I http://localhost -H "Host: whs.rotechrural.com.au"

# Check permissions
ls -la /var/www/whs/storage/

# Check logs
tail -f /var/www/whs/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### Check Both Applications
```bash
# QA (with SSL)
curl -I https://qa.rotechrural.com.au

# WHS5 (via IP)
curl -I http://147.79.67.122
```

- **Folder**: /var/www/whs (simple path)
- **Database**: whs5_production (versioned)

### Current Access
- **Direct URL**: http://147.79.67.122 ✅ Working
- **Domain URL**: http://whs.rotechrural.com.au ⏳ Pending DNS
- **With SSL**: https://whs.rotechrural.com.au ⏳ After DNS + SSL setup
