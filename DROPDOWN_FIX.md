# User Dropdown Menu Fix

## Issue
The user dropdown menu in the navbar was:
1. **Always visible** (stuck in open state)
2. **Logout button not working**
3. **Dashboard/Profile links not clickable**

## Root Cause
The dropdown panel had the `hidden` attribute in the HTML, but the CSS was missing the rule to hide elements with `[hidden]` attribute. This caused the dropdown to display even when it should be hidden.

## Solution Applied

### 1. CSS Fix (resources/css/sensei-theme.css:2583-2585)
Added the missing CSS rule to properly hide the dropdown when the `hidden` attribute is present:

```css
.sensei-user__dropdown[hidden] {
  display: none;
}
```

### 2. Rebuilt Assets
Ran `npm run build` to compile the updated CSS into production assets.

### 3. Cleared Caches
Cleared Laravel view and application caches to ensure the new assets are loaded.

## How It Works Now

### JavaScript Logic (resources/js/app.js:72-126)
The existing JavaScript code:
- Toggles the `hidden` attribute on click
- Adds/removes the `is-open` class for animations
- Updates `aria-expanded` for accessibility
- Closes dropdown when clicking outside
- Closes dropdown on ESC key

### CSS Behavior
- **Closed state**: `hidden` attribute present → `display: none` (invisible)
- **Open state**: `hidden` attribute removed → `display: flex` (visible with animation)

## Testing
1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R to force reload)
2. Click on your user avatar/name in the top right
3. Dropdown should toggle open/close smoothly
4. Clicking "Log Out" should work and log you out
5. Clicking outside the dropdown should close it
6. Pressing ESC should close the dropdown

## Files Modified
- `resources/css/sensei-theme.css` - Added `[hidden]` attribute styling
- `public/build/assets/sensei-theme-Bloq4zVw.css` - Rebuilt production CSS

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Clear caches (already done)
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear

# Verify logout route exists (confirmed working)
php artisan route:list --name=logout
```

## Notes
- The JavaScript was already correct
- The logout form (POST to /logout with CSRF token) was already correct
- Only the CSS hiding mechanism was missing
- No need to modify any Blade templates or JavaScript
