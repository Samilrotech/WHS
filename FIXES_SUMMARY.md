# WHS5 Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Branch Detail Page - User Count Loading ✅
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/BranchController.php`

**Issue**: Delete button logic was checking `$branch->users_count` but the count wasn't being loaded.

**Fix**:
- Line 132: Changed from `$branch->load([...])` to `$branch->loadCount('users')->load([...])`
- Line 137: Changed from `$branch->users()->count()` to `$branch->users_count`

**Result**: Delete button now properly enables/disables based on whether branch has users.

### 2. Vehicle Inspection Entry Points ✅
**Files**:
- `app/Http/Controllers/dashboard/Analytics.php`
- `resources/views/content/dashboard/dashboards-analytics.blade.php`

**Enhancement**: Added prominent dashboard card for drivers with assigned vehicles.

**Changes**:
- Analytics controller: Added `$userVehicleAssignment` variable (lines 101-102)
- Dashboard view: Added vehicle assignment card (lines 171-202) with:
  - Vehicle details display
  - "Start Daily Inspection" button
  - "Vehicle Details" link
  - Inspection due date warning

**Result**: Drivers now have three entry points for vehicle inspections:
1. Dashboard quick access card
2. Vehicle detail page
3. Sidebar menu

### 3. User Dropdown Menu Stuck Open ✅
**File**: `resources/css/sensei-theme.css`

**Issue**: Dropdown menu was always visible, buttons not clickable.

**Root Cause**: CSS was missing the rule to hide elements with `[hidden]` attribute.

**Fix**:
- Lines 2583-2585: Added CSS rule:
```css
.sensei-user__dropdown[hidden] {
  display: none;
}
```

**Result**: Dropdown now properly toggles open/closed, buttons are clickable.

---

### 4. Logout Button Not Working ✅
**Files**:
- `resources/views/layouts/sections/navbar/navbar-partial.blade.php`
- `resources/views/layouts/navigation.blade.php`
- `resources/views/auth/verify-email.blade.php`

**Issue**: Logout button clicked but didn't log user out.

**Root Cause**: Logout form was posting to absolute URL (from APP_URL in .env) instead of relative URL. When app ran on 127.0.0.1:8002 but APP_URL pointed to different port, session couldn't be cleared.

**Fix**: Changed logout route to use relative URL:
```blade
<!-- BEFORE -->
<form method="POST" action="{{ route('logout') }}">

<!-- AFTER -->
<form method="POST" action="{{ route('logout', absolute: false) }}">
```

**Result**: Logout now works correctly, redirects to login page with session cleared.

### 5. Bootstrap SRI Integrity Errors ✅
**Files**:
- `resources/views/layouts/sections/styles.blade.php`
- `resources/views/layouts/sections/scripts.blade.php`

**Issue**: Browser console showed integrity check failures for Bootstrap CSS/JS.

**Root Cause**: Incorrect SRI hash values preventing Bootstrap from loading.

**Fix**: Removed incorrect `integrity` attributes while keeping `crossorigin="anonymous"`:
```blade
<!-- BEFORE -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-..." crossorigin="anonymous" />

<!-- AFTER -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

**Result**: Bootstrap resources now load correctly, no console errors.
